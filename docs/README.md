## ABOUT

This project was developed for Stephen Grider's "Node With React: Fullstack Web Development" course on udemy.com.  It provides a way for startup owners to create simple user experience surveys and tabulate results from respondants via email.  It also makes use of a simple payment method using Stripe.  The backend is developed using Node.js, Express, and MongoDb.   The front end uses React for view logic and Redux to manage state.
